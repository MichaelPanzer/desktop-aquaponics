This is a work in progress to create a small-scale modular aquaponics system. 

The plan is to create a frame from alumium extrusion which can support stackable grow trays. Water will be pumped to the top and allowed to cascade down through the layers. COB grow lights will be attached to the bottom of each tray in order to light the plants below. The lights, pump, and any other accesories will be controled with an arduino.
